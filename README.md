# Job_Search
Script that checks for open Job Positions in Imperial Valley

This code requires Selenium Chromedriver to be downloaded in order to run the script. 
Chromedriver needs to be the same version as your current chrome version when downloading. 

After downloading, place the chromedriver in the path of the local git repository and add the directory path of the chromedriver to your system's PATH variable
